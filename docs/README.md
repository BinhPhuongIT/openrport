#OpenRPort

OpenRPort is a fork of rport that was discontinued and closed by RealVNC
At a glance
OpenRport helps you to manage your remote servers without the hassle of VPNs, chained SSH connections, jump-hosts, or the use of commercial tools like TeamViewer and its clones.

OpenRport acts as server and client establishing permanent or on-demand secure tunnels to devices inside protected intranets behind a firewall.

All operating systems provide secure and well-established mechanisms for remote management, being SSH and Remote Desktop the most widely used. OpenRport makes them accessible easily and securely.

Watch our short explainer video.

Is OpenRport a replacement for TeamViewer? Yes and no. It depends on your needs. TeamViewer and a couple of similar products are focused on giving access to a remote graphical desktop bypassing the Remote Desktop implementation of Microsoft. They fall short in a heterogeneous environment where access to headless Linux machines is needed. But they are without alternatives for Windows Home Editions. Apart from remote management, they offer supplementary services like Video Conferences, desktop sharing, screen mirroring, or spontaneous remote assistance for desktop users.

Goal of Rport Rport focuses only on remote management of those operating systems where an existing login mechanism can be used. It can be used for Linux and Windows, but also appliances and IoT devices providing a web-based configuration. From a technological perspective, Ngrok and openport.io are similar products. OpenRport differs from them in many aspects.

OpenRport is 100% open source. Client and Server. Remote management is a matter of trust and security. OpenRport is fully transparent.
OpenRport will come with a user interface making the management of remote systems easy and user-friendly.
OpenRport is made for all operating systems with native and small binaries. No need for Python or similar heavyweights.
OpenRport allows you to self-host the server.
OpenRport allows clients to wait in standby mode without an active tunnel. Tunnels can be requested on-demand by the user remotely.
Supported operating systems For the client almost all operating systems are supported, and we provide binaries for a variety of Linux architectures and Microsoft Windows. Also, the server can run on any operating system supported by the golang compiler. At the moment we provide server binaries only for Linux X64 because this is the ideal platform for running it securely and cost-effective.
